== NVIDIA DGX BasePOD
DGX BasePOD is an integrated solution consisting of NVIDIA hardware and software components, MLOps solutions, and third-party storage. Leveraging best practices of scale-out system design with NVIDIA products and validated partner solutions, customers can implement an efficient and manageable platform for AI development. Figure 1 highlights the various components of NVIDIA DGX BasePOD.

Key specifications of the DGX A100 system are:
* Eight NVIDIA A100 GPUs.
* 40 GB or 80 GB GPU memory options.
* Six NVIDIA NVSwitch™ chips.
* Dual AMD EPYC™ 7742 CPUs, 128 total cores, 2.25 GHz (base), 3.4 GHz (max boost).
* Up to 2 TB of system memory.
* Eight NVIDIA ConnectX-6 or ConnectX-7 InfiniBand HCAs.
* Two 1.92 TB M.2 NVMe drives for DGX OS, eight 3.84 TB U.2 NVMe drives for storage/cache.
* 6.5 kW max power.

More information about DGX A100 systems is available here.

The rear ports of the DGX A100 CPU tray are shown in Figure 5. Four of the single-port HCAs are used for the InfiniBand compute fabrics. Each pair of dual-port HCAs provide parallel pathways to the storage and management fabrics. The out-of-band port is used for BMC access.

=== NVIDIA Networking
==== NVIDIA QM8700 Switch

NVIDIA QM8700 switches (Figure 11) with HDR InfiniBand connectivity power the compute fabric in HDR BasePOD configurations. ConnectX-6 single-port adapters are used for the InfiniBand compute fabric. Each NVIDIA DGX system has dual connections to each QM8700 switch providing multiple high-bandwidth, low-latency paths between the systems.

==== NVIDIA SN4600 Switch

NVIDIA SN4600 switches (Figure 12) offer 128 total ports (64 per switch) to provide redundant connectivity for in-band management of the DGX BasePOD. The NVIDIA SN4600 switch can provide for speeds between 1 GbE and 200 GbE.For storage appliances connected over Ethernet, the NVIDIA SN4600 switches are also used. The ports on the NVIDIA DGX dual-port HCAs are used for both in-band management and storage connectivity.

==== NVIDIA SN2201 Switch

NVIDIA SN2201 switches (Figure 13) offer 48 ports to provide connectivity for out-of-band management. Out-of-band management provides consolidated management connectivity for all components in BasePOD. 

==== NVIDIA Connect-X 6 HCA
